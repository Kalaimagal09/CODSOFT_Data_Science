## Projects Overview

### Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
* **Description:** Built a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic binary classification problem.
* **Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, Classification Metrics.

---

### Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction
* **Description:** Developed a regression model to predict the rating of a movie based on features like its genre, director, and actors.
* **Skills:** Data Preprocessing, EDA, Feature Engineering (Label Encoding), Regression (Random Forest Regressor), MAE, RÂ² Score.

### Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
* **Description:** Created a multi-class classification model to identify an iris flower's species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) from its petal and sepal measurements.
* **Skills:** Multi-class Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors), EDA (Pairplot), Model Evaluation.

### Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection
* **Description:** Built a classifier to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset.
* **Skills:** Handling Imbalanced Data (Undersampling), Feature Scaling (StandardScaler), Classification (Logistic Regression), Precision-Recall Metrics.
